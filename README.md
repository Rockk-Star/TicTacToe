## How to play?

1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
2. 2 Players take turns putting their marks (usually X and O) in empty squares.
3. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
4. When all 9 squares are complete, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
